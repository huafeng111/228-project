# ECE228-project, Team 19: Kinship Verification using Neural Networks
This is the project repository for Group 19, Kinship Verification using Neural Networks.

Please download the data set from [Northeastern SMILE Lab - Recognizing Faces in the Wild](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/recognizing-faces-in-the-wild/data) and extract the data directly in the directory of this repository.

### Project Team Members:
- Huafeng Ma, humai@ucsd.edu
- Xiao Xia, xxia@ucsd.edu
- Yue Wu, yuw138@ucsd.edu

### Requirements:
Please see requirements.txt

### Instruction of Notebooks
run final-model-with-facenet-and-vgg.ipynb

### Code Depth
In our project, we take pretrained VGG Face and FaceNet models but we changed parameters can be trained.\
Also we figured out a new feature extraction formula to help us improve model performance.
